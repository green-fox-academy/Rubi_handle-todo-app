No need to store it to a variable if you are not working with it anymore....minor stuff, but you know it is pretty hard to find something in your code :D

Honestly I would just get rid of all the methods with scanner, it is quite confusing, if you can have input from argument and at the same time from scanner. 

remember the SRP principle? - if you have time for that I would suggest to divided your code into more services, Eg a service/class for handling the I/O etc....there are more ways....

A lot of code is in main, lets try to keep main as simple as it is :)

I think you are pretty good programmer, but honestly I kinda struggle reading your code, if you can keep it simple, that would be great, not just for the mentors, but generally for your future coleagues.

But overAll I think it is really good :) Great job!
